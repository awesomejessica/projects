# Predicting Parkinsonâ€™s Using Speech Analysis

Speech recording data were gathered from participants and analyzed to see which participants had Parkinson's. Machine learning classification models, support vector machine (SVM) and neural network, were 
created in the code from svm.py and neuralnetwork.py to predict these results. The results were analyzed using metrics
such as accuracy scores, an ROC curve, and a confusion matrix.
